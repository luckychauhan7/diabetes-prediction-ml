Machine learning project for diabetes risk prediction using Random Forest

A complete ML pipeline for diabetes risk prediction on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset featuring a Random Forest classifier, standardized preprocessing, reproducible training/evaluation, a CLI predictor for one‑off inputs, and a Streamlit dashboard for data exploration and real‑time inference; intended for learning and baseline benchmarking, not for clinical use.
